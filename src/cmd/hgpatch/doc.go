Hgpatch reads a patch, which should have been generated by
a version control system like CVS, GIT, Mercurial, or Subversion,
from a file (or standard input) and applies that patch to the local
Mercurial repository.  If successful, it writes a list of affected
files to standard output.

Hgpatch is meant to be used by the Mercurial codereview extension.

Usage:
	hgpatch [patchfile]
